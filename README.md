# rxver
A new versioning system based  on the timespan of the project going.

## Default Format

```
[YYYY].[BUILD].[PUBLISH_INCREMENT_YEAR] [MATURITY_LEVEL_CODE]
```

## Build

This section includes the build created in that year in increment format. eg. In 2020, we will have 2020.0.0 as the start version and 2020.1.0 as the next build. For coming year 2021 we will have 2021.0.1 as the first version.

## Code Maturity Level 

1. `Neonate`
    
    The start phase of any software.
    
2. `Sprog`

    The evolving phase where base features are ready and complete.

## Example

1. `2020.0.0 Neonate`

    This release was created in 2020, a first build of the year.
    
2. `2021.0.1 Neonate`

    2021 as release year, and a first build with second release year.

Note: Both have `Neonate` as they are still being  developed heavily.
